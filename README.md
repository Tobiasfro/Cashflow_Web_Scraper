# Cashflow Webscraper

## How to use
Since you have to be logged in as an admin the webscraper will need a valid admin session cookie. 

In cashflow_scraper.py, there are two empty dictionaries, cookies and headers. The video below shows how to generate these 2 dictionaries. When they are generated, just copy and paste them into the python file and you are set to use the webscraper. Just make sure to also download via pip the libraries requests, html5lib and beautifulsoup4
